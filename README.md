# Vocabulary evaluation of LLMs


This repository contains the results for the different vocabulary tests run on LLM tools/models presented in the paper: **"The continued usefulness of vocabulary tests for evaluating large language models"** currently under review at the Journal of Memory and Language.


The name of the files correspond to the vocabulary tests for which results are presented in Tables 3-6 in the paper (note that questions for the TOEFL test are not public).  

In each file, the first column has the question posed to the LLM tool/model, followed by the correct answer. The rest of the columns correspond to the answers of the different LLM tools/models evaluated.  The results and percentages are summarized at the bottom of the file after the last test items.
